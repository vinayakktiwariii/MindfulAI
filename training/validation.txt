User: I honestly do not understand it myself. Maybe its my stupid monke brain that is just missing people, a real person. One person I chose to be around, not my family or the hateful people I am forced to be around at school. Someone that I would not jump out a window to avoid in public. It just makes me sad to realise I am probably not going to meet a person like that. I do not like to socialise but I am lonely
